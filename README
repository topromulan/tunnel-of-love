Python tunnel of love

A further experiment in generators program designs

Listens on a list of ports.

Each port may be associated with a ship to board and disembark.

Players telnet to a port and manifest a lover.

A player on an empty (of ship, not player) port can charter a ship to come.

The player who charters the ship becomes the financier.

The first player aboard a chartered ship becomes the skipper.

The ship accepts embarkees until the skipper disembarks the ship

If a connection aborts then the player expires in some fashion (falls off ship, blows self up, etc.).

Otherwise, the ship proceeds into the tunnel of love associated with the port disembarked from.
